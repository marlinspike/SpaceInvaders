### Space Invaders
A basic space invaders clone written using Python and PyGame. This is a nice intro to game 
programming for kids, once they're past basic console text games.

### Requirements
- Pygame

### Gameplay
This is Space Invaders as I remembered it as a kid! I felt like a kid makign and each time I play,
I feel like a kid for a few seconds again! It's a really simple game -- prevent the Enemies from getting to the bottom of the screen by shooting them. Each time one is destroyed, it gets re-spawned at a random location.

**Points:**
* 100 for a kill
* Minus 10 for a miss
